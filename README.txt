Description:
------------
In the Jukebox plus mod you've got 9 different music discs.

You can add music by copy your ogg file to the sounds folder and renaming them to e.g. this:
jukebox_disc_2.0.ogg
But pay attention that the sounds have to be mono, else you can hear the music all over the world.

There are 9 discs so there are the sound files jukebox_disc_1.*.ogg to jukebox_disc_9.*.ogg.
The small star can be replaced by the numbers 0 to 9.

So you can have up to 9x10 (90) songs!


Using the mod:
--------------

To use the jukebox, you have to craft one. You need 8 wood and 1 mese crystal to craft it following way:

wood      wood      wood
wood  mese crystal  wood
wood      wood      wood


Just rightclick with a music disc in your hand on the jukebox and it will play a random song from this disc.
To stop the music rightclick the box again and it will drop the music disc.
